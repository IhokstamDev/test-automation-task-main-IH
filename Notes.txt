## Running the Tests

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`

Ensure Next.js app is running by typing yarn dev in a shell.

In this repo assignment 3 additional folders have been created with accompanying tests for the Supermetrics Kitty Manager. The below folders are:

1. Automated Tests - Cypress tests to test functionality/behaviour of Supermetrics Kitty Manager. 
   To run the tests type the command: yarn run cypress open

2. Manual Tests - Tests written in Gherkin format based on specification i.e. Give When Then

3. Peformance tests written in K6 - Install K6 to run the performance tests. Go to https://k6.io/ for information on installing and setting up K6.
Run command - k6 run PerfTestLoginPage.js to run the the peformance test.
The test PerfTestLoginPage.js works as follows - it simulates a progressive ramp-up from 0 to 15 virtual users (VUs) for duration of ten seconds. Then the 15 virtual users will remain at 15 VUs 20 seconds, and finally, it will ramp down over a duration of 10 seconds to 0 virtual use.
A performance goal is set in terms of a performance threshold where 95th percentile response time is below 5000 ms (5 seconds).
If results 90% of response if more than 5000 ms then the test returns a fail (non-zero exit code) otherwise a pass (zero exit code)

4. The account password hardcoding has been removed. You can set the password in cypress.env.json file. 
To avoid storing the account password in the repro it has been added to .gitignore file.
To set up password add snippit below for example for admin password
 {
    "admin_username": "admin",
    "admin_password": ""
 }
